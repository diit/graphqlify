# DEPRECATED
## Check out some great projects continuing this work!

## [Gramps](https://gramps.js.org/)
> GrAMPS is a better way to manage GraphQL data sources. By standardizing the way GraphQL data sources are defined, we can allow multiple teams to own their own data sources with independent codebases, then compose them together in a single GraphQL server.

> Plus, data sources can be shared, so you can use open source GrAMPS data sources along with your own custom data to build full-featured GraphQL endpoints without reinventing the wheel each time.

## [GraphQL-Binding](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-binding/issues/28)
> GraphQL bindings are modular building blocks that allow to embed existing GraphQL APIs into your own GraphQL server. Think about it as turning (parts of) GraphQL APIs into reusable LEGO building blocks.
